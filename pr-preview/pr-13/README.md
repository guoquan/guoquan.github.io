## Development Guidelines

### Pull Request Preview

Pull requests automatically deploy a preview version to GitHub Pages. Check the PR status checks for a preview URL under the `pr-preview/` path before merging.
The preview deploys to the `main` branch and ignores the `CNAME` file so it uses the default `github.io` domain rather than the production custom domain.
