## Development Guidelines

### Pull Request Preview

Pull requests automatically deploy a preview version to GitHub Pages. Check the
PR status checks for a preview URL under the `pr-preview/` path before merging.
Previews deploy to a dedicated `pr-preview` branch using the repositoryâ€™s
default `github.io` domain instead of the custom domain.
The preview directory is excluded from builds and is automatically
removed when a pull request is closed.
CI waits for the preview URL to respond with HTTP 200 before marking the check
as successful, following any redirects.
